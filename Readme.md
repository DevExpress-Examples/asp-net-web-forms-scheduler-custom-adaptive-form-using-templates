The ASPxScheduler controls supports two mechanisms to create a custom Appointment Form:

1. Using a custom View Model API:
[How to: Customize the Appointment Dialog using View Model API (working with custom fields)](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/119731/aspnet-webforms-controls/scheduler/examples/customization/custom-form-and-custom-fields/how-to-customize-the-appointment-dialog-using-view-model-api-working-with-custom-fields)
2. Creating a custom User Control:
[How to: Customize the Appointment Editing Form for Working with Custom Fields](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/5464/aspnet-webforms-controls/scheduler/examples/customization/custom-form-and-custom-fields/how-to-customize-the-appointment-editing-form-for-working-with-custom-fields)
If the 1st mechanism (View Model API) is used, a custom Appointment Form is adaptive by default.
In the case of using the 2nd approach, you need to create a built-in Popup Window.


This example demonstrates how to use the ASPxFormLayhout control in [responsive mode](https://demos.devexpress.com/ASPxNavigationAndLayoutDemos/FormLayout/ResponsiveLayout.aspx?device=phone&rotate=0) as the main form's container to make a custom Appointment Form adaptive.
