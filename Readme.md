# Scheduler for ASP.NET Web Forms - How to create a custom adaptive appointment form using templates (User Control)
<!-- run online -->
**[[Run Online]](https://codecentral.devexpress.com/324958574/)**
<!-- run online end -->

This example demonstrates how to use the [ASPxFormLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxFormLayout) component in responsive mode as the main form container to make a custom appointment form adaptive.

## Implementation Details

The [ASPxScheduler](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxScheduler.ASPxScheduler) control supports two approaches to create a custom appointment form.

* [Customize the Appointment Dialog using View Model API](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/119731/components/scheduler/examples/customization/custom-form-and-custom-fields/how-to-customize-the-appointment-dialog-using-view-model-api-working-with-custom-fields). When you use this approach, custom appointment form is adaptive by default. 
* [Customize the Appointment Editing Form for Working with Custom Fields](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/5464/components/scheduler/examples/customization/custom-form-and-custom-fields/how-to-customize-the-appointment-editing-form-for-working-with-custom-fields). When you use this approach, you should implement adaptivity of custom appointment form manually.

In this example, the custom appointment form contains [ASPxFormLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxFormLayout) component. The [SettingsAdaptivity](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.ASPxFormLayout.SettingsAdaptivity) property is spesified to provide the form with responsive layout.

```aspx
<SettingsAdaptivity>
    <GridSettings WrapCaptionAtWidth="810">
        <Breakpoints>
            <dx:LayoutBreakpoint MaxWidth="810" ColumnCount="1" Name="S" />
        </Breakpoints>
    </GridSettings>
</SettingsAdaptivity>
```
